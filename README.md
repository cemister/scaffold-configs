# scaffold-configs
YAML templates for [Scaffolder](https://github.com/cemister/scaffolder)

Those are templates; feel free to fork this repo and modify them or make your own.
After making a commit, the raw content will update only after ~5 minutes. So make sure that 5 or more minutes passed since you ran the tool and got error AND since last commit here before creating an issue.
